This project will be used for testing of CI system with Jenkins.
Also CatLight will help us monitor Jenkins builds in order to notify if something went wrong.

- Jenkins server will run on AWS EC2 instance.
- We created jenkins pipeline as CI/CD pipeline.
- Jenkinsfile is our pipeline as code that helps us create a pipeline for the process. Jenkins server will use this file from github.
